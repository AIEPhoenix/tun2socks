tun2socks
=========

![](https://travis-ci.org/zhuhaow/tun2socks.svg?branch=master)

tun2socks is designed to work with the NetworkExtesion framework available since
iOS 9 and OS X 10.11. It is based on the lasted stable lwip with minimal
modification.

Usage
-----

Just read the comments in the Swift wrapper in `tun2socks/wrapper`.

You may be more interested in using [NEKit](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit)
which wraps around tun2socks.

Current, only TCP packet is supported, UDP support is coming soon.

All other protocols (ICMP, IGMP, ...) will not be supported.

IPv6 support
------------

As of now, IPv6 is not supported since lwip 1.4 does not support dual stack.
IPv6 will be supported in the next major version of lwip.
